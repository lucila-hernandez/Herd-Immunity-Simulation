# Herd Immunity Simulation Project

## Description
This project simulates the spread of a virus through a population to demonstrate the concept of herd immunity. The simulation models interactions between individuals in a population where some are vaccinated against the virus. The purpose is to understand how vaccination rates impact the spread of the virus and the overall health of the population.

## Language Used
- Python

## How to Use
To use this project, follow the step below:

1. Run the following command in your terminal: python3 simulation.py <population_size> <vacc_percentage> <virus_name> <mortality_rate> <repro_rate> <initial_infected>

Here's an example of how to run the simulation:

+ Population Size: 100,000,
+ Vaccination Percentage: 90%,
+ Virus Name: Ebola,
+ Mortality Rate: 70%
+ Reproduction Rate: 25%
+ People Initially Infected: 10

Then you would type: 
python3 simulation.py 100000 0.90 Ebola 0.70 0.25 10
