Herd Immunity Simulation Answers

1. What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)
Population size: 100,000
Percent vaccinated: 90%
Virus name: Ebola
Mortality rate: 90%
Reproductive rate: 1.5

2. What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
0.1% of the population became infected 

3. What percentage of the population died from the virus?
Total Deaths: 82
Percentage of population that died: 0.082%

4. Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many times, in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?
I estimate that 90% of the interactions where an infecton could spread were "prevented" due to vaccination.
